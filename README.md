### Installing and optimizing new nvidia drivers on windows 11 gaming PC:
#### more to come

---

```python
run NVCleanstall.exe:
download driver
use driver files on disk
check PhysX, Microsoft Visual C 2017 Runtimes and just NvApp checkbox (was NV container)
disable installer telemetry & advertising
perform clean install
disable MPO
disable Ansel
show expert tweaks
disable HDCP
build package
```

---

#### Reset/disable GPU overclock/Fans/Auto-startups (Afterburner/ect)
#### Disable internet (âŠž Win+R ncpa.cpl)

---

```python
press âŠž Win+R > type msconfig > boot > safe boot
reboot
press âŠž Win+R > type msconfig > boot > safe boot > uncheck > exit without restarting*
run DDU uninstall (as admin) > options > remove physX > Clean and restart
install driver (as admin, just Driver w/o app/custom/clean install)
```

---

```python
NVIDIA Control Panel:
Adjust image settings with preview > Use my preference emphasizing > Performance > Apply
Use the advanced 3D image settings > Apply
Manage 3D settings > Global Settings > Anisotropic filtering > Appplication-controlled or off/4x/8x/16x
Manage 3D settings > Global Settings > Low Latency Mode > Off (Ultra can cause lag/stutter on certain API, new API decide this for you usually)
Manage 3D settings > Global Settings > Power management mode > Prefer maximum performance
Manage 3D settings > Global Settings > Preferred refresh rate > Highest available
Manage 3D settings > Global Settings > Shader Cache Size > Unlimited (def is too low for lots of games will cause compile shader lag, stutters and slow compiling)
Manage 3D settings > Global Settings > Anisotropic sample optimization > On (nul on High quality)
Manage 3D settings > Global Settings > Negative LOD bias > Allow (Clamp if not scaling)
Manage 3D settings > Global Settings > Texture filtering Quality set to High performance (or High quality)
Manage 3D settings > Global Settings > Trilinear optimization On (nul on High quality)
Configure Surround, PhysX > set PhysX to GPU
Change resolution > set resolutions and refresh rates
Change resolution > NVIDIA color settings set Output color depth and Full dynamic range (all monitors)
Adjust desktop color settings > Digital vibrance 100% (all monitors)
Adjust video color settings > With the NVIDIA settings > Advanced > Dynamic range Full 0-255 (all monitors)
```

```python
System > Display > Graphics > Default graphics settings:
Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling > On
Optimizations for windowed games > On
System > Display > Color management > Automatically manage color for apps > off (24h2 broke color fix)
```

#### Enable GPU overclock/Set fans higher than defaults/Auto-startups (Afterburner/ect)

---

#### reboot
#### when changing settings things could need to be reapplied make sure you check everything before gaming
#### Enable internet

ðŸŸ©

Maximum Pre-Rendered Frames/Low Latency Mode/Future Frame Rendering/Nvidia Reflex On+Boost(Prefer maximum performance)/AMD Anti-Lag/ULLM
you can change this 1 threw 8 in nvidiaProfileInspector but new stuff like reflex and frame gen play with these (i mean ai)
Old school default was 3, 2 or more could give you more fps at cost of latency
best bet is the use whats in the game and lowest and go up from there if its stuttering/laggy because some settings don't like some modes

ðŸŸ©

Windows Game Mode (test yourself an optimized system wont benefit in my experience)
Settings > Gaming > Game Mode > Off
reg add "HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\GameBar" /v "AllowAutoGameMode" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
reg add "HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\GameBar" /v "AutoGameModeEnabled" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f

ðŸŸ©

nvidiaProfileInspector (as admin) (click magnifying glass for more options):
Texture Filtering - LOD Bias set what you want (Negative LOD bias needs to be set to Allow)
CUDA - Force P2 State off or on (test per-game)

ðŸŸ©

FPS cap (for keeping under max VRR or using LFC and keeping thermals and utilization down)
Manage 3D settings > Global Settings > Max Frame Rate
Manage 3D settings > Global Settings > Background Application Max Frame Rate

ðŸŸ©

ReBAR:
Enable above 4g and rebar in your bios (if its supported)
rBAR in nvidiaProfileInspector (as admin):
rBAR Enabled (rebar can cause games to stutter/lag randomly) (test per-game)
rBAR Options set (test per-game)
rBAR Size Limit set (test per-game)

ðŸŸ©

VRR (FreeSync/G-Sync/AdaptiveSync) could be easier on the eyes and the VRR with LFC (Low Framerate Compensation) could make games feel smoother. Set Off for lowest lantency.
NVIDIA Control Panel:
Set up G-SYNC > Enable settings for the selected display model (turn monitor off and on for windows to figure it out) (or turn off and disable in monitor OSD)
System > Display > Graphics > Default graphics settings:
Variable refresh rate On or off

ðŸŸ©

Custom resolutions:
Change resolution > Customize... (might have to lower a DP1.4 to DP1.2 and/or turn off DSC(Display Stream Compression) to get the button to work)
Add resolutions 3328x1872 (3.25K) is mint for people who cant yet push 4k

ðŸŸ©

Monitor .icc/icm profile:

1. put ICC Profiles in here open âŠž Win+R %SystemDrive%Windows/System32/spool/drivers/color
2. open âŠž Win+R colorcpl.exe (click add and add ICC profiles, click Add as HDR Profile for hdr icc profiles)
3. find manufactures icc profile or search for them or buy a monitor calibration tool (or use phone) (remember calibration is subjective)

Quick SDR/HDR calibration:

1. System > Display > Color profile > sRGB to Gamma2.2 (srgb_to_gamma2p2_sdr.icm) (SDR)
2. System > Display > Color profile > SDR ACM: srgb_d50 [ srgb_to_gamma2p2.cal ] (srgb_to_gamma2p2_400_mhc2.icm) (HDR)
3. find these on github they have a nice gamma roll from zero

Windows HDR Calibration:

1. download MicrosoftCorporationII.WindowsHDRCalibration_1.0.152.0_neutral_~_8wekyb3d8bbwe.Msixbundle (or newer)
2. turn monitor on HDR mode
3. turn on HDR in windows
4. calibrate

someone make a app that does peak brightness/save profile and we can adjust gamma/saturation with sliders in real time

ðŸŸ©

High Precision event timer (HPET) on or off (test i leave it on)

ðŸŸ©

Enable Message Signaled Interrupts with programs like NVCleanstall 
test MSIs settings like high/irqPolicySpreadMessagesAcrossAllProcessors default 40 series cards drivers enable MSIs on default
Enable manually with registry editor:
Open Device Manager > right click on GPU > Properties > Events (tab) > Device id
&&&_&&&&&&&&_&&&&&&&&&&&_&&&&&&&&&&&&_&&\&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& (looks like this)
replace with your GPU device ID
reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\PCI\&&&_&&&&&&&&_&&&&&&&&&&&_&&&&&&&&&&&&_&&\&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&\Device Parameters\Interrupt Management\MessageSignaledInterruptProperties" /v "MSISupported" /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
reboot
```
