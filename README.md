#### ðŸŸ© Extra

```python

ðŸŸ© nvidia Profile Inspector:

nvidiaProfileInspector (as admin) (click magnifying glass for more options)
edit _GLOBAL_DRIVER_PROFILE (Base Profile) or games name to add/edit settings (create profile)
i guess the "override" functions change to latest DLSS4 version baked into the driver over dlss3? (test)
Enable DLSS-FG override (Enhanced FG/lower vram usage and better)
Enable DLSS-RR override (Ray Reconstruction/test fps/quality difference)
Enable DLSS-SR override (DLSS4 will override DLSS3 from driver somehow test what version)
Override DLSSG multi-frame count (50 series)

to see what preset you are using type this on/off command in cmd.exe (press âŠž Win+R cmd)
on*
reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\NVIDIA Corporation\Global\NGXCore" /v "ShowDlssIndicator" /t REG_DWORD /d 1024 /f
off*
reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\NVIDIA Corporation\Global\NGXCore" /v "ShowDlssIndicator" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
Override DLSS-RR preset (set to 0x0000000A "Preset J" is the Transformer model)
Override DLSS-SR presets (set to 0x0000000A "Preset J" is the Transformer model)

Texture Filtering - LOD Bias set what you want (Negative LOD bias needs to be set to Allow) (for testing)
CUDA - Force P2 State off or on (test per-game)

-------------------------------------------------------------

ðŸŸ© NVIDIA App/FrameView App:

NVIDIA App (install exe) (Alt+Z) (nvidiaProfileInspector is better)
uses ~256mb of vram when open on home screen, 100mb vram in graphics, little more ram few more exes
requires "nvcontainer.exe" and/or "NVIDIA app.exe" internet telemetry to work, then you can block it (restart app for it to work)
run Autoruns and uncheck \NVIDIA app SelfUpdate_{}
run Autoruns and uncheck nvvad_WaveExtensible (nvvad64v.sys,NVIDIA Virtual Audio Device)
FrameView App for overlay (install exe) (test)
NVIDIA Overlay.exe(s) run at higher priority
FvSvc (nvfvsdksvc_x64.exe,FrameViewSDK) allows statistics overlay
Reboots your PC if you have other programs using "PresentMon_x64.exe"

-------------------------------------------------------------

ðŸŸ© frame latency stuff:

Maximum Pre-Rendered Frames/Low Latency Mode/Future Frame Rendering/Nvidia Reflex On+Boost(Prefer maximum performance)/AMD Anti-Lag/ULLM
you can change this 1 threw 8 in nvidiaProfileInspector
Old school default was 3, 2 or more could give you more fps at cost of latency
best bet is the use whats in the game and lowest and go up from there if its stuttering/laggy because some settings/modes conflict

-------------------------------------------------------------

ðŸŸ© Windows Game Mode:

test yourself an optimized system wont benefit in my experience
Settings > Gaming > Game Mode > Off
reg add "HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\GameBar" /v "AllowAutoGameMode" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
reg add "HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\GameBar" /v "AutoGameModeEnabled" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f

-------------------------------------------------------------

ðŸŸ© FPS cap:

for keeping under max VRR or using LFC and/or keeping thermals and utilization down
best practice -2fps under refresh rate
do not use with frame gen
NVIDIA Control Panel
Manage 3D settings > Global Settings > Max Frame Rate
Manage 3D settings > Global Settings > Background Application Max Frame Rate

-------------------------------------------------------------

ðŸŸ© ReBAR:

Enable above 4g and rebar in your bios (if its supported)
rBAR in nvidiaProfileInspector (as admin)
rBAR Enabled (rebar can cause games to stutter/lag randomly/crash) (test per-game)
rBAR Options set (test per-game)
rBAR Size Limit set (test per-game)

-------------------------------------------------------------

ðŸŸ© VRR:

FreeSync/G-Sync/AdaptiveSync
could be easier on the eyes and the VRR with LFC (Low Framerate Compensation) could make games feel smoother
Set Off for lowest latency
Only way to tell if VRR is working is in monitor on screen display (OSD) some games might need to be changed to fullscreen and/or boarderless back and forth for VRR to actually work
NVIDIA Control Panel
Set up G-SYNC > Enable settings for the selected display model (might need turn monitor on/off) (or turn off and disable in monitor OSD)
System > Display > Graphics > Default graphics settings:
Variable refresh rate On or off

-------------------------------------------------------------

ðŸŸ© Custom resolutions:

Change resolution > Customize... (might have to lower a DP1.4 to DP1.2 and/or turn off DSC(Display Stream Compression) to get the button to work)
Add resolutions 3328x1872 (3.25K) is mint for people who cant yet push 4k

-------------------------------------------------------------

ðŸŸ© HDR/SDR profiles:

Monitor .icc/icm profile
1. put ICC Profiles in here open âŠž Win+R %SystemDrive%Windows/System32/spool/drivers/color
2. open âŠž Win+R colorcpl.exe (click add and add ICC profiles, click Add as HDR Profile for hdr icc profiles)
3. find manufactures icc profile or search for them or buy a monitor calibration tool (or use phone) (remember calibration is subjective)

Quick SDR/HDR calibration
1. System > Display > Color profile > sRGB to Gamma2.2 (srgb_to_gamma2p2_sdr.icm) (SDR)
2. System > Display > Color profile > SDR ACM: srgb_d50 [ srgb_to_gamma2p2.cal ] (srgb_to_gamma2p2_400_mhc2.icm) (HDR)
3. find these on github they have a nice gamma roll from zero

Windows HDR Calibration
1. download MicrosoftCorporationII.WindowsHDRCalibration_1.0.152.0_neutral_~_8wekyb3d8bbwe.Msixbundle (or newer)
2. turn monitor on HDR mode
3. turn on HDR in windows
4. calibrate

-------------------------------------------------------------

ðŸŸ© High Precision event timer:

High Precision event timer (HPET) on or off (test i leave it on) (press âŠž Win+R devmgmt.msc)

-------------------------------------------------------------

ðŸŸ© Message Signaled Interrupts:

Enable Message Signaled Interrupts with programs like NVCleanstall
default 40 series cards drivers enable MSIs on default

Enable manually with registry editor
Open Device Manager > right click on GPU > Properties > Events (tab) > Device id
&&&_&&&&&&&&_&&&&&&&&&&&_&&&&&&&&&&&&_&&\&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& (looks like this)
replace with your GPU device ID
reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\PCI\&&&_&&&&&&&&_&&&&&&&&&&&_&&&&&&&&&&&&_&&\&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&\Device Parameters\Interrupt Management\MessageSignaledInterruptProperties" /v "MSISupported" /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
reboot

-------------------------------------------------------------

ðŸŸ© HWiNFO64:

*nvidia 572.16 drivers reboot pc when gaming with HWiNFO64.exe (Afterburner/RTSS should be working)
set polling period global 2000ms (general tab)
only check validate windows positions/PresentMon Support/Remember Preferences (General/user interface)
disable everything in Safety tab (main settings)
Shrink window by removing rightmost table (arrows pointing on bottom of program)
disable monitoring/logging everything but these (disable everything then add them in Layout tab)
Framerate (Presented)
GPU Temperature
CPU Package (temp)
GPU Core Load
Max CPU/Thread Usage (100% on a core could be memory leak)
GPU Memory Allocated (VRAM)
Physical Memory Used (RAM)
```
